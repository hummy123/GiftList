# Screencast Order

This .md file exists as a plan about the order to test functionality for the screencast.

I apologise for not having a webcam or microphone to speak with. 

I intend highlight the specific functionality being tested in the screencast, and then to switch to the browser tab to test it.

Apologies if the screencast is hard to follow without a microphone, but I'll try my best.

## Stage 1.

### Part 1.
The home screen should be viewable whether the user is logged in or not and should display a summary of all the events that lists have been created for, including:

1. A brief title
2. A thumbnail image
3. The date of the event formatted as DD/MM/YYYY

### Part 2.
If a user is logged in there should be a button or link on the homepage to allow them to create a new event. The following information should be requested:

1. The event title
2. A full-size image to represent the event uploaded from their computer.
3. The date when the event is taking place selected from a date picker.
4. A detailed, multi-line, formatted description of the event.
5. Space to add up to five items to be added to the list, each to include the name, price and link to the online details.

### Part 3.
Users should be able to click on one of the photos or event titles to be taken to an event details screen which includes:

1. The details of the event (see previous point)
2. A list of the items wanted with each item showing its status (the name of the person who has pledged the item).
2. 1. NOTE: This bullet point has been superseded by Stage 3, which states: "The itel list should only show the name and thumbnail of the item. Clicking on the item in the list should display a details page that includes all the item details as well as any questions and answers."
3. If the item has not yet been pledged, the user can click on a checkbox which assigns their name to pledge the item.

## Stage 2. 
The list of requests should not be limited to five items, users should be able to add as few or as many as they want.
