# Screencast Order

This .md file exists as a plan about the order to test functionality for the screencast. The tasks are taken from https://github.coventry.ac.uk/agile/projects/blob/master/10%20Gift%20List.md .

---

## Stage 1.

### Part 1.
The home screen should be viewable whether the user is logged in or not and should display a summary of all the events that lists have been created for, including:

1. A brief title
2. A thumbnail image
3. The date of the event formatted as DD/MM/YYYY

### Part 2.
If a user is logged in there should be a button or link on the homepage to allow them to create a new event. The following information should be requested:

1. The event title
2. A full-size image to represent the event uploaded from their computer.
3. The date when the event is taking place selected from a date picker.
4. A detailed, multi-line, formatted description of the event.
5. Space to add up to five items to be added to the list, each to include the name, price and link to the online details.

### Part 3.
Users should be able to click on one of the photos or event titles to be taken to an event details screen which includes:

1. The details of the event (see previous point)
2. A list of the items wanted with each item showing its status (the name of the person who has pledged the item).
2. 1. NOTE: This bullet point has been superseded by Stage 3, which states: "The item list should only show the name and thumbnail of the item. Clicking on the item in the list should display a details page that includes all the item details as well as any questions and answers."
3. If the item has not yet been pledged, the user can click on a checkbox which assigns their name to pledge the item.

## Stage 2. 
1. The list of requests should not be limited to five items, users should be able to add as few or as many as they want.
2. When a user pledges an item the system should send an email to the person who set up the list to let them know of the pledge. The email should contain:
2. 1. A description of the pledge and its value
2. 2. A link to the event screen
3. When the original user receives the pledge (for example goods were delivered) they should be able to set the status of this on the system which should send out a personalised thank you email to the donor.


## Stage 3.
1. Users should be able to send messages and questions to the person who created the list.
2. Each question should be linked to a specific item in the list.
3. Each question should display on the app and should also be sent as an email to the list owner.
4. The list owner should be able to post a reply which should be displayed on the page and sent as an email.
5. The itel list should only show the name and thumbnail of the item. Clicking on the item in the list should display a details page that includes all the item details as well as any questions and answers.
6. All emails should include a link to the product details page for the product mentioned in the email.
